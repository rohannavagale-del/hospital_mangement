Overview

This project is a concept-level mini healthcare
support web application designed to demonstrate how basic web technologies 
and AI-inspired automation can be used to assist healthcare NGOs or support teams. 
The application allows users to submit health-related queries and receive an immediate 
AI-assisted acknowledgment


Tech Stack:

HTML – Structure of the form and layout

CSS – Styling and responsive UI

JavaScript – Form handling, logic, and automation

(Optional backend can be added in future)


AI / Automation Idea:

The app includes an AI-assisted auto-response system:

Automatically generates a response after form submission

Categorizes the issue (e.g., general health concern)

Identifies urgency level based on user input



NGO / Healthcare Use Case

This system can be useful for:

Healthcare NGOs handling large volumes of patient queries

Volunteer or patient support request management

Initial triaging of health concerns before human follow-up


Future Enhancements:

Backend integration with database

Email notifications

Advanced AI models for symptom analysis
